Thermal cameras can be paired with regular security cameras for maximum security.

Built-in sensing units pick up movement within the camera's field of view and trigger video recording.</p>
<p>A tight wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to neglect things that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
