<p>After testing lots of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be set up both indoors and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

<p>While Scout's normally simple on the wallet, it does have one big failing: it charges extra for self-monitoring. Systems like Nest Secure, House, and Ring Alarm will all let you self-monitor your system for free. However Scout makes you pay a $10 monthly membership fee. Wamp wamp.

<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most cost-effective monitoring plan beginning at $10. You can get all the fundamentals like push, email, and sms informs, along with 4G LTE cellular backup and battery for Scout's least expensive, Constantly On" plan.
