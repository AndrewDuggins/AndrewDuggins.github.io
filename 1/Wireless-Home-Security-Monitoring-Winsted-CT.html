<p>The second essential thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably raucous in-built alarm, so it works as a home alarm system as well as a security camera.

<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the precise very same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the alarm system. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, removing the requirement for further wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, usually via 110VAC power. </p>
