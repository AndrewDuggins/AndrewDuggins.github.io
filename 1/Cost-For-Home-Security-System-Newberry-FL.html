<p>For these different systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, an in-depth understanding of all the required systems is needed. There are just 2 options if there are no as-built documents offering functionality and configuration information to make this integration work. The first alternative, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is reluctant or unavailable to offer those information) and document the geography and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and change, carrying out a total upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>
<p>Furthermore they can not transmit fluid video, only still frame images or low resolution bits of video. Blink Security Cameras are a fine example of a system we are constantly helping consumers change. As specialists in the market our guidance is to keep away.
