<p>Take a while to check out online reviews and not simply those on the company's website. Take a look at the Better Business Bureau website specifically. If a customer has a lodged a problem about the company, its personnel, or its equipment, it will be on that website. Other third-party reviews websites must be inspected too. Think about asking neighbors for recommendations on security systems too. They might even suggest a local company with a strong track record that can expertly install the equipment.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that they work using a digital signal which can be saved directly to a computer, these cameras do not need a video capture card. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is basic for DVD-video, and has a greater compression ratio than 5:1, with a somewhat lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be used up versus the quality of photo needed or wanted). The highest image quality of DVD is just a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
