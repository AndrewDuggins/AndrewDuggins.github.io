In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a personal security personnel. Several cities also require an authorization to even operate a home and own security system.

<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is an extremely common type of two piece sensor that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either typically open or usually closed when under the influence of an electromagnetic field as when it comes to proximity to the second piece which includes a magnet. When the magnet is moved far from the reed switch, the reed switch either opens or closes, again based on whether or not the design is generally open or normally closed. This action coupled with an electric current (normally at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to find a fault on that zone or circuit. These kind of sensors are really common and are discovered either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can typically be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
