This usually includes finding an area for your camera, creating an account in the app, and linking the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

Some designs use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and connect to the within your door, while others need that you remove your existing interior and exterior escutcheons and change the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
