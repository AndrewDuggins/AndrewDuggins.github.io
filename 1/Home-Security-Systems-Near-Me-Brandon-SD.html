<p>Various kinds of CCTV cameras. All of the cameras were simple to install. Each camera has an app that strolls you through the setup process. This usually includes finding an area for your camera, creating an account in the app, and linking the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

<p>Lastly, I have a look at a home security system's app, ensuring it's easy to use and technically sound, specifically if there is home automation included. I also examine app reviews from the Apple and the Google Play shops, looking for home security apps with scores of at least 3 stars or above.

Some designs use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and connect to the within your door, while others need that you remove your existing interior and exterior escutcheons and change the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
