<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
