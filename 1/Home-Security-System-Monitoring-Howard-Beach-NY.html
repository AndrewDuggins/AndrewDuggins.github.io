<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
