<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly charge for a set amount of time, generally one to 5 years.

These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that use a discount rate in exchange for that lengthy service agreement.
