<p>Xiaomi's Mi Home Security Camera isn't quite as cheap as our previous pick in this classification-- the $20 Wyze Web Cam V2-- but Xiaomi's Mi Home Security Camera is an even better value at $40.

<p>We attempted each of the cameras in several places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we checked each camera using an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android smartphone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint uses a wide range of equipment and home automation products at a reasonable rate, the one area where the company especially excels is in DIY installation. </p>
