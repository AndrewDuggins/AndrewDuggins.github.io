<p>Another factor to consider with wireless home security systems is the minimal series of sensors. A lot of radio frequencies are weak outside a range of 500 feet.

When aiming to buy a surveillance camera, there are a couple of factors to consider.</p>
<p>Another benefit to monitored systems is if you buy a monitored security plan, the very same company that keeps an eye on the system will install it for you.

Wireless cameras can't have all of it-- see things inside by day, and watch on what's going on outside after dark. It hardly ever works.</p>
