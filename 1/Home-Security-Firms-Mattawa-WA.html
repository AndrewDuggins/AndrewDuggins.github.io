<p>Face acknowledgment, however, is only one kind of automated video analysis being deployed with surveillance cameras.

However, you do require to register for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated.
