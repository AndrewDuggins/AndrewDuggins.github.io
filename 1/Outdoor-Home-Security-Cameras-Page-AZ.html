The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the current trend in U.S. policing of permitting 3 or 4 totally free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front incentives to motivate owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
