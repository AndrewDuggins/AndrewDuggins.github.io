The keypad enables you to enter your security code in case the alarm is triggered while you are at home. Choose an accessible positioning that works for you.</p>
<p>From monitoring windows and doors, to making certain the pool gate is secure, to getting a message when your safe is accessed, and even guarding the medicine in the restroom cabinet - the sensing units are small adequate to use distinct protection not provided with hard-wired alarm systems. When the camera observes motion within its field of view, cameras with motion detection can send you notices. These alerts can notify you to suspicious activity so you can monitor the situation.</p>
