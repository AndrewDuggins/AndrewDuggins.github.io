<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. In a network injection attack, a hacker can use access points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, specifically relaying network traffic such as Spanning Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects fake networking re-configuration commands that impact routers, switches, and smart hubs. A whole network can be lowered in this manner and need rebooting or perhaps reprogramming of all intelligent networking gadgets.</p>
