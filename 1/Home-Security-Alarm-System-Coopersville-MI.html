The one time where lag does end up being a little a problem is between taping and discovering movement.

Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the risk and, if needed, could merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
