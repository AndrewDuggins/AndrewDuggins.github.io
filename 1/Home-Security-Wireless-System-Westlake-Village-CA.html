Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
