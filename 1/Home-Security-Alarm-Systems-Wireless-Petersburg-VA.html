<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.
