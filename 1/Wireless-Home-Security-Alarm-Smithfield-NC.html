<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical. If a property owner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by an area cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>
