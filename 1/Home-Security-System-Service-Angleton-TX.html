<p>Almost all outdoor security cameras are equipped with a motion sensor that will activate the camera to record video when motion is discovered. The sensor can also initiate a push alert to your phone when activity is happening, and some will also create an e-mail alert. For an extra layer of security, try to find a camera with sound detection that can let you understand if someone is out there even if they run out range of the camera lens and the motion sensing unit. Fair warning: You'll most likely need to tweak the sound sensitivity settings to prevent informs from barking pet dogs, loud cars and trucks, and other random noises.</p>

<h3>Alarm House System in Angleton TX</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
