<p>Potentially. It depends upon which security company you choose. Many expertly monitored home security systems require a contract, and contract length can vary from 3 to 5 years.

From there, Alexa will cycle your lights on and off to make it appear like you're home - and you'll also get a notice if your Echo speakers hear the noise of an alarm, or damaged glass.</p>
<p>The integration of digital video surveillance and access control is part of the natural convergence of security technologies.
