To recoup costs and hold alarm companies accountable for false alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company should be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm costs, and provide physical proof like camera footage or a broken window to warrant police reaction.</p>
