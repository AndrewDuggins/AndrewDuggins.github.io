We enjoy that the system includes a wifi security camera and just alerts you when motion is created by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect alerts). However, you do require to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated.
