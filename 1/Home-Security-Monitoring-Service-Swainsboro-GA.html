<p>After testing dozens of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be established both inside and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.
