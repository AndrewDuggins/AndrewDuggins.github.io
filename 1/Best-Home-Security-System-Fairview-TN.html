<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users must reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such events. Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? area from our wise video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we don't think that these concerns alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our present suggestion.</p>
