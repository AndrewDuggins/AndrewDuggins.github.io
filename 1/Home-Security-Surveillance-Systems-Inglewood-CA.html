<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even identify people you've identified (after a knowing duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be expensive however is important. In reality, we do not recommend purchasing this camera at all unless you prepare to add the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera discovered activity. Being able to compare a cars and truck and an individual, for instance, permits you to minimize unneeded alerts.
