<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal considering that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store.
