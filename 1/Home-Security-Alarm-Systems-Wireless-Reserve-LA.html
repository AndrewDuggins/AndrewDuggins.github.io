<p>Also called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you specifically reroute the field of view without remounting the security camera each time. They're fantastic for storage facilities. Some of these might resemble dome cameras, but there's a basic technique to differentiate them - if the lens and the IR LEDs are in front of the glass on the real estate rather than contained behind it, you have actually got a turret camera instead of a dome.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine individuals the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send out smart device alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
