In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a private security guard. A number of cities likewise require a permit to even operate a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are developed to limit the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many towns will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
