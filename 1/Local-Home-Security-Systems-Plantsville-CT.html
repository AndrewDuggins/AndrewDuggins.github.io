When you think of a home security camera, it's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might call to mind.

<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to third party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams given that they were bought by Google. Something all of us need to think about. Sirens. So your camera has spotted burglars or wild animals. Do you wish to frighten them off?
