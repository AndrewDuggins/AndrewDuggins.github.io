<p>I explained that all we would need to do is take advantage of any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise consisted of two-way audio, which camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency button, it sends dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.
