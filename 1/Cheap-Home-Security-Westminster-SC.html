Modern systems now have remarkable abilities", though these have created easy to understand misgivings about the threat for personal privacy and possible abuse such capabilities develop. Porter therefore noted that the Home Office and surveillance market must ensure only hardware and software compliant with relevant standards, such as Secure by Default, is installed in private and public areas alike.</p>
