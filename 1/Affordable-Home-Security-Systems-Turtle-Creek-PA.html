<p>GO2 offers full-service Video Surveillance Installation of hd (HD), IP, digital, outdoor, and wireless Security Camera Systems. ADT's six customer monitoring centers (more than any other security company has) make certain your security never ever goes offline. Your home's protection is immediately transferred to another center if one monitoring station deals with an interruption of service. Wireless security systems that are technically sophisticated and more versatile to use typically have better features than the conventional systems.</p>
<p>We didn't think about alarm systems that required professional installation. Pro-installed systems generally cost more, use equipment similar to that of DIY systems, included typically difficult and long agreements, and often rely on the exact same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they provide little benefit. A good example is the Vivint system, which we have actually reviewed separately and do not suggest for many people.</p>
