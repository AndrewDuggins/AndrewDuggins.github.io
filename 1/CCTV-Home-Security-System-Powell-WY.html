<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are practically similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more costly for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are burdensome, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyway.</p>
<p>Frontpoint equipment rates is on the low end, but its monitoring services begin at a slightly higher price point than the entry-level services of its rivals. However, Frontpoint uses all clients benefits that are typically only readily available through higher-tier strategies at other suppliers, such as complete mobile app access and Crash & Smash" protection. In general, Frontpoint rates represents a good value as long as DIY installation works for you (and it's even better if you can score a seasonal discount ).
