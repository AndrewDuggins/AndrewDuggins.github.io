<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of burglar alarms work the precise very same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut.
