<p>A wired security system was the first type of security system that was invented for homeowners. It must be installed by an expert alarm installation group and, when set up, is tough to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more typical for large properties and are often more expensive than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera similar to the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to rework the existing wires in your home. If you've currently installed a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system, the team will be able to reuse the existing electrical wiring. However, if this is your first system, the alarm installation process can take upwards of three hours.</p>
