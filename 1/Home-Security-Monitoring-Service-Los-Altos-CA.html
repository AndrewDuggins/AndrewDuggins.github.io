<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are almost similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are a little more pricey for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are onerous, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not particularly cutting-edge, so we're truly advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy option. Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year agreement, but since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So pick what will be the better deal for you. If you know you'll sit tight for a minimum of 3 years, go with the contract and gain those savings. However if you might update to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best option.</p>
