<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
