<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send smartphone informs with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
