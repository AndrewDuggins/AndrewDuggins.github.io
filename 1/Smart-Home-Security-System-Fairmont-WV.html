<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your information to third party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams considering that they were bought by Google. Something we all need to think of. Sirens. So your camera has actually spotted burglars or wild animals. Do you want to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will suffice.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
