In 2007, I contracted with ADT to install a home security system and monthly robbery and fire monitoring. The total installation charge alone was not cheap-- numerous thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Including Ring Alarm makes sense if you currently own a Ring video doorbell and desire to expand your home security coverage.

Search for an outdoor camera that will integrate with other smart home devices such as garage door openers, external sirens, and smart switches.</p>
<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that admit to a home's security app to approximately 20 family members. However, shared monitoring isn't a function offered from all companies. Be sure to look into the company's functions or speak with a representative straight if this is a high top priority.
