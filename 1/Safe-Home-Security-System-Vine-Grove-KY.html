<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". This model from Samsung Wisenet will fit the costs if you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality. It ships with four white and smooth bullet-style cameras created for indoor and outdoor use. They're geared up with night vision tech that uses infrared LEDs and clever IR to provide up to130ft (or 40m) night vision range. Like others on our list, the DVR system works with a mobile app that lets you see what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we discovered in our testing that the app sometimes forgot cameras which then required to be re-added.</p>
<p>Link Interactive might have a great deal of equipment, however it's not always the most attractive things out there. Plus, Link Interactive's not as popular of a brand name as, state, ADT.

Therefore, the panel and the app they feature for making use of this system have been fine-tuned make it exceptionally easy to use.

The app is offered in the app shops for both iPhone and Android devices.</p>
