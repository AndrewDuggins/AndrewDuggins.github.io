Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range.

<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which could be an affordable alternative for customers in rural areas.

A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the porch by a licensed electrical expert (who occurs to be my partner). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside your home (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
