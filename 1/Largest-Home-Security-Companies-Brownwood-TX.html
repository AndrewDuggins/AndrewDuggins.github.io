The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after almost 2 years of use, day and night images have actually constantly been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing motion, a problem we came across when evaluating the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted.
