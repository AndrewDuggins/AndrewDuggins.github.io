The camera then streams a video-link to your phone (or Amazon Echo Program, if you have one of those) - and because it works as an intercom, you can then have a chat with the person at the door if you so dream. Helpful if, for example, it's the postman and you're out. You can advise him or her where to leave the products.</p>
<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the patio by a certified electrical contractor (who occurs to be my partner). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside your home (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
