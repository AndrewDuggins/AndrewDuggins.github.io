They'll also send out an alert to your phone when somebody or something is out there, record video of the event, and depending upon features, let you speak to whoever is on your residential or commercial property, all without ever having to open your door (or even be within your house, for that matter).</p>

<p>Once upon a time, installing a security system could be an extremely expensive affair: An expert monitoring company would offer the equipment, locking you into a costly, multi-year agreement. In today's Do It Yourself smart home world, though, new competitors have gotten in the fray that make home security a lot more luring.

The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers bring into question the suitability of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four complimentary false alarms per fiscal year, since they provide no up-front rewards to encourage owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
