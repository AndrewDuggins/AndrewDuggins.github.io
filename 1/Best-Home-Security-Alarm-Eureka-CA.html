<p>There are two outdoor security camera styles - dome or bullet-shaped. Due to the fact that they offer a 360 swivel that makes it tough to identify their instructions, the dome-shaped outdoor security camera is known to be less obvious to unwanted visitors. On the other hand, bullet-shaped cameras are more typical. They have a cylinder shape that plainly stands out to alert burglars that your home is under surveillance.</p>
