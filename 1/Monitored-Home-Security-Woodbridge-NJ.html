<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is an enjoyment to utilize as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you wish to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's great, though. If you do not currently have an Arlo camera or more in place, you're going to need to install a center that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can indicate there are range concerns.</p>

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly groundbreaking, so we're truly recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice.
