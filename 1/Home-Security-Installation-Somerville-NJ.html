<p>Wi-Fi cameras aren't simply for capturing a thief in the act, though. They're likewise useful for casual home monitoring. Placed on counter tops, shelves, and tables, they allow you to keep an eye on what your animals are doing, understand when the kids get back from school, or discover who's been striking the liquor cabinet. Most even enable you to interact with whoever is on-camera as the action is taking place, through an embedded microphone and speaker.</p>
