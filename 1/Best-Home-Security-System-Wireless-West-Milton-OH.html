<h2>Security Alarm Monitoring West Milton</h2>
<p>In the past, a surveillance security system usually consisted of a number of cameras linked-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which taped the images and showed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor.

<p>Consider it in this manner, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more sophisticated camera be sold for the low rate of forty dollars?

<p>However, in any situation where standard-definition camera are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TELEVISION lines but the results are the same); they usually record vertical and horizontal fields of lines and mix them together to make a single frame; the optimum frame rate is usually 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even identify people you have actually identified (after a knowing duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
