When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system.

Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
