In a network injection attack, a hacker can utilize access points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, particularly transmitting network traffic such as Spanning Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects phony networking re-configuration commands that affect routers, switches, and intelligent hubs.
