<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its understated appearances and face recognition software. The latter allows you to see precisely when a particular person arrives at the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. However Netatmo has broadened its security range with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to introduce a wise smoke alarm and siren later this year, which makes this an even better proposal.</p>

Our tester stated the service technician offered strong customer support: He dropped a few unnecessary window sensors from my expense after choosing that the motion detector was sufficient for the whole front half of my home." Nevertheless, there were some problems with linking the command hub to our tester's network. </p>
