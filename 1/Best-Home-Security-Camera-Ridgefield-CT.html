<p>Despite having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and include another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension set, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 ends up being more costly general per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it given that its battery-saving regimens can disrupt efficiency.</p>
