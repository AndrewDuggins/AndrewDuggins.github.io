<h2>Who's Monitoring Your Alarm System 24 Millersburg</h2>
<p>In the past, a surveillance security system usually consisted of a number of cameras connected-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which taped the images and showed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor. Nowadays, it's a lot easier to have a standalone security camera. Whether you have one camera or a number of, they work with your home's web network to send video footage right to your computer system or mobile phone.
