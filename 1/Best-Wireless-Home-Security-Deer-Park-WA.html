<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>

It's excellent for a car park or a warehouse, where the finer details aren't as crucial as the total photo.
