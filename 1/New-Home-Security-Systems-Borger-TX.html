<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
