<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. If catching video footage in the dark is a top priority, ensure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
