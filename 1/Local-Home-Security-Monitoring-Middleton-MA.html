<h3>Local Home Security Monitoring in Massachusetts</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the maker's stats considering that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest culprit for brief battery life without a doubt. We concur with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, however its recording capability is a bit minimal to recommend as a top pick.</p>
<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly cost for a set amount of time, typically one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than dedicating to a long-lasting plan, are ending up being more typical. These systems often cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that use a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement. Spending for the equipment in advance offers you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as sometimes as you want.</p>
