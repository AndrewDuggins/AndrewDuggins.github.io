The same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much image details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>

<p>Video and image feeds have shown invaluable for surveillance - but there's room for more performance by utilizing audio. Human beings have five senses that jointly permit us to accurately range our environment. Therefore, it just makes good sense that a security system that engages as many senses as possible is more efficient.
