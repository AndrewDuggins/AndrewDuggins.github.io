Because they have larger internal video sensing units and higher-quality parts that can adjust and catch outstanding low light video, commercial cameras surpass their more affordable cousins.</p>

<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, frequently use battery-powered transmitters which are easier to install and have less expensive start-up expenses, however might fail if the batteries are not kept. Depending upon distance and construction materials, one or more wireless repeaters may be needed to bring the signal to the alarm panel dependably. A wireless system can be relocated to a new home quickly, an advantage for those who lease or who move often.
