Now, many security systems involve a multitude of components, such as a base station, security camera, glass, motion, and entry break sensing units, a keypad, and key fobs, to name a few components. But I also appreciate minimalist systems that components that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some parts can make home automation readily available to you. Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensing unit, smart lock, etc.), I want to make certain that they all quickly interact with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
