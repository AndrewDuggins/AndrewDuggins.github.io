According to a report published by the Urban Institute, police departments nationwide react to millions of false alarms from person and business security systems every year. This costs towns and cities millions of dollars in squandered cops resources. The Vivint Smart Home security system is reliable and easy to utilize, but pricey and wacky unless you desire the convenience of a pro install and upkeep.</p>
