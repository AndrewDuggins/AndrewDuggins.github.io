<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it records a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device alerts and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor.
