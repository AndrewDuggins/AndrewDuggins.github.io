<p>Any outdoor camera worth its salt need to have the ability to withstand exposure to the components and ought to carry an IP (Ingress Protection) ranking IP ratings consist of two digits that tell you just how well the camera will hold up under a lot of weather conditions. The first digit following the IP prefix informs you how resistant the camera is to the ingress of strong items such as wind-blown dust and ranges from 0 (no protection) to 6 (total protection against dust and dirt). The second number tells you how resistant the camera is to moisture and ranges from 0 (no protection) to 9 (protected versus close range, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>
<p>For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment this way to make clients stick with them longer, since switching monitoring companies means numerous dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for customers. Alexa assistance is included, as you would get out of an Amazon-owned brand name, and the camera competently deals with all the normal functions when it concerns motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is included too, for when the lights go out. </p>
