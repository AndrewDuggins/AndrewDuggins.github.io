<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their quick reaction times and overall adaptability. And controlling our system with their touchscreen panel was effortless and pretty darn streamlined. Otherwise, this company provides a similar feature-set as brands like Frontpoint and Brinks. With the quality of the equipment that is available today, it's safe to state that the wireless systems are simply as good, if not better, than the wired systems. Offered all of the other advantages, it's simple to see why so many individuals are selecting this option. </p>
