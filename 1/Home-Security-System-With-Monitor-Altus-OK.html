<h2>The Truth About Video Surveillance Altus</h2>
<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can handle such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

Home security systems are one way to offer your home and household additional protection. It does not matter whether you live in among the most safe neighborhoods in Houston or not; there are a range of home alarm features that can help you feel safe.</p>

With some, it's difficult to inform at a look where they've been aimed, so they can provide a panoptic impression as a deterrent, no matter their real field of view.
