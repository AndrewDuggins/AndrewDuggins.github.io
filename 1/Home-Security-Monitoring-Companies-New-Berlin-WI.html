<p>We didn't consider alarm systems that required expert installation. Pro-installed systems generally cost more, usage equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, come with typically burdensome and long contracts, and typically rely on the exact same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little benefit. A fine example is the Vivint system, which we've reviewed individually and don't advise for many people.</p>

Now, a lot of security systems include a multitude of parts, such as a base station, security camera, entry, glass, and motion break sensing units, a keypad, and essential fobs, to name a few components. But I also appreciate minimalist systems that elements that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some parts can make home automation available to you. Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensing unit, wise lock, and so on), I want to make sure that they all easily communicate with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
