<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
