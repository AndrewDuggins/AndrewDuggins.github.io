A discreet, motion-detecting nanny-cam" style security camera for your child's room? How about a surveillance system outside your home that captures every angle to protect your family and property?

<p>Video surveillance is cost scalable and efficient. As your business grows, adding and integrating additional cameras into an established network is economical and simple. We're also a huge fan of Ring's Neighbors app. This app lets you, your neighbors, and cops send out notifies if there's trouble in the neighborhood.

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is definitely something to be taken into account. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal.

<p>It depends on the size and design of the monitoring and the home objectives. The advantages of cameras are that you can get visual confirmation of any activity occurring inside or outside the home.

The highest photo quality of DVD is only slightly lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
