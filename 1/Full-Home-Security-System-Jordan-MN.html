<p>The Ring Floodlight Camera combines 2 important devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera spots movement, it switches on its 2 powerful LED beams in addition to its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording.

This camera uses a variety of functions consisting of a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I explained it as extremely middle of the road.

This newer variation is much the same, to be frank.</p>

Currently, no Do It Yourself home security systems deal with HomeKit, but if you're a Google Resident, you might choose to choose among our other picks. </p>
