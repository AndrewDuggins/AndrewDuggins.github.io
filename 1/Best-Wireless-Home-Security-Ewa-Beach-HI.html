Outdoor security cameras inevitably cost more than their indoor cousins, because-- for starters-- the need to be protected from the elements.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
