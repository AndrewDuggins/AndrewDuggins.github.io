<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company. When the system identifies a break-in, fire, or other emergency situation, it alerts the security team and, in many cases, emergency responders.

And with video innovation most likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear borders for what CCTV systems should have the ability to do poses a considerable threat.</p>
