<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long method, spanning several years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly developed into the extremely advanced yet budget-friendly systems readily available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to record video and view it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
