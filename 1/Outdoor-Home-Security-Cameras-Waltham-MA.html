We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).

<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is an extremely typical kind of two piece sensor that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either normally open or usually closed when under the influence of a magnetic field as in the case of proximity to the 2nd piece which consists of a magnet. When the magnet is moved far from the reed switch, the reed switch either opens or closes, once again based on whether or not the design is normally open or normally closed. This action paired with an electric existing (usually at 12V DC) permits an alarm control board to spot a fault on that zone or circuit. These kind of sensors are extremely common and are found either wired straight to an alarm control board, or they can usually be discovered in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
