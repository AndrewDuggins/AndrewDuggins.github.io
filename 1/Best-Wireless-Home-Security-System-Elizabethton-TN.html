<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, frequently use battery-powered transmitters which are much easier to install and have more economical start-up costs, but may fail if the batteries are not preserved. Depending on distance and building products, one or more wireless repeaters may be needed to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably. A wireless system can be moved to a new home quickly, an advantage for those who rent or who move frequently. The more crucial wireless connection for security is the one in between the control panel and the monitoring station. Wireless monitoring of the alarm system protects against a burglar cutting a cable television or from failures of an internet provider. This complete wireless setup is commonly described as 100% wireless.</p>
<p>In addition to the system itself, security alarms are frequently coupled with a monitoring service. In case of an alarm, the premises control unit contacts a main monitoring station. Operators at the station see the signal and take appropriate action, such as contacting property owners, alerting cops, or dispatching private security forces. Such signals might be transferred via devoted alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the internet.</p>
