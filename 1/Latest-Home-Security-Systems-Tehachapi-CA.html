Homeowners can customize the system to their needs and can choose to have the system professionally installed or do it themselves. Unlike other monitoring alternatives, self-monitored systems don't have a month-to-month monitoring cost.</p>
<p>Another element to think about is security, a wireless connection is somewhat easy for hackers to access.

<p>The bright side is that the WPA3 is currently here and will change WPA2.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
