<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>So why do not we rank ADT higher? In some ways, ADT annoys us. We see a lot of growing companies branching off and trying new things in the home security space. But ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its rates isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to mention that the customer service experience varies commonly depending on the dealer you go with. </p>
