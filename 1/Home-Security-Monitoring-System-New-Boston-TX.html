<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
