<p>One of the top home security service providers since going into the business in 1992, Protect America provides service for hundreds of thousands of consumers around the United States and Canada. They provide flexibility in their equipment and available plans, enabling homeowners to select the security option that best fits their needs. Regrettably, there are some downsides to Safeguard America shown by their low C- ranking from BBB. A majority of the grievances center around misinformation relating to the mandatory 3 year agreement. In truth, the majority of clients were not conscious they were making such a long term dedication. This, combined with the extreme penalty for premature cancellation-100% of the remaining balance plus paying for all of the equipment-may offer some time out in choosing Protect America as their home security option.</p>
