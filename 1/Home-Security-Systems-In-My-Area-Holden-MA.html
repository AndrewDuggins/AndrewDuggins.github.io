<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company. When the system spots a break-in, fire, or other emergency situation, it informs the security group and, sometimes, emergency responders.

And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear borders for what CCTV systems need to have the ability to do presents a substantial danger.</p>
