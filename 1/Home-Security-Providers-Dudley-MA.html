We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare individuals and basic motion.
