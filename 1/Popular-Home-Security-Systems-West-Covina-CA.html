<p>Ooma Smart Security is configured and managed utilizing wireless sensing units and the Ooma Smart Security mobile app for iOS (Apple) or Android devices. As soon as you have the app set up, you can configure your sensing units depending on the package you acquired. SimpliSafe is not terrific at clever home assistance.

SimpliCams aren't produced outdoor use. You can install one outside the home with an outdoor kit SimpliSafe deals.

<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 monthly, but you'll pay a bit more if you wish to include extra features, like a security camera. While a normal contract runs 42 months (one of the longer contract terms on our list), that requirement is just for users who want to rent their equipment. If you buy your equipment upfront, Vivint has no minimum contract requirement.</p>
<p>False alarms are expensive for the City of Plymouth. Police respond to thousands of incorrect alarms each year.
