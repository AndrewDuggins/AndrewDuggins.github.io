We initially saw Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out notifies, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
