Prior to signing up with Ziff Davis, John invested six years in retail operations for Federated Stores, Inc. before accepting a buying position with Morris Decision Systems, one of New York's very first value-added resellers of the initial IBM PC.

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false complacency since it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
