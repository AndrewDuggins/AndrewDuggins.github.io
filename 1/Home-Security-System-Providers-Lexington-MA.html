<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
