At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm should be enough to scare away trespassers in many cases.

Your alarm company must be certified, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and provide physical evidence like camera video or a broken window to necessitate police action.</p>
