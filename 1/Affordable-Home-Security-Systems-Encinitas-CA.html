<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>

When comparing camera types and prices, keep the following 3 factors in mind. Cameras that record 4K (Ultra HD) video are also available, but you'll need a very strong network connection to stream it without experiencing choppiness or lag, and you'll need lots of space to store recorded video, which might lead to expensive cloud storage charges. </p>
