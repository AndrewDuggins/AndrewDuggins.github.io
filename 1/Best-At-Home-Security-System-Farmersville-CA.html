<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
