<p>Above is an easy summary of the uses, but alarms can benefit any place where security could be enhanced.

<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Ring for a well-priced DIY system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small fee. Since it comes with several door and window sensing units for full coverage, we suggest the eight-piece set. We also suggest adding a doorbell camera at some time. The Ring Base Station lets you connect Ring Alarm parts so that you can monitor them through the Ring App. The Ring Base Station also integrates with Alexa-enabled devices.</p>
<p>Professional installation was practically the only way to put in a home security system 15 years earlier. Innovation has come such a long method that DIY systems can offer the same level of security (and typically more) with a self installed system. Even more, there can be fringe benefits to a DIY system since they're generally much easier to transfer to another home if you move. For someone trying to find a more complex setup like home automation, or somebody that wants a trained specialist to make the recommendation for the setup, professional installation is an excellent alternative. We have actually found that most people that were worried about self setting up a home security system actually wound up finding the procedure very easy. There are companies out there like Frontpoint that are known to be particularly helpful in this stage.</p>
