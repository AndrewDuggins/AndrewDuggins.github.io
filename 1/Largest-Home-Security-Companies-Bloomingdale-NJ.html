<p>Since it's more complex than it needs to be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

Which's what Nest provides you.</p>
