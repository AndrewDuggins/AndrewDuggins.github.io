We likewise found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
