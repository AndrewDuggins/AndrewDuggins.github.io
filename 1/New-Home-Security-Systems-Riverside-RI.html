<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. The clever bit is that the camera not just identifies that people have entered its 130-degree visual field, however it will also have a stab at identifying them too. Possibly more usefully, if someone passes who the camera doesn't understand, you get an alert about an "unidentified face". You can inform the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it must immediately understand.</p>
<p>We didn't consider alarm that required professional installation. Pro-installed systems normally cost more, use equipment similar to that of DIY systems, included long and generally burdensome contracts, and frequently rely on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they provide little benefit.

We have actually seen some improvements given that the camera's launch, and will continue to test and upgrade this review, as needed.</p>

It's fantastic for a parking lot or a storage facility, where the finer details aren't as crucial as the total picture.

What you lose in resolution, specifically at the edges of your field of view, you offset in dependability.</p>
