<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm system, a variety of companies provide "totally free monitoring services" for the first few months. Lots of insurance provider use discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to consumers with operable alarm. These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many authorities departments use several "free" incorrect alarms prior to imposing any fine, although the cost to react is considerable right from the start.
