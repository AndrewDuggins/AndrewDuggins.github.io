So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I remained in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Actually irritating.

I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to mention it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, since obviously they car restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a written not by mail.

Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
