This camera uses a wide variety of functions including a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I explained it as decidedly middle of the road.

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment.
