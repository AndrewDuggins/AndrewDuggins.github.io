<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that give access to a home's security app to approximately 20 member of the family. However, shared monitoring isn't a function available from all companies.

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send mobile phone alerts with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
