We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and general motion.
