<p>Numerous other models were disqualified due to performance concerns. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video in the dark is a concern.</p>
<p>Activity notices notify the user whenever significant activity is discovered near the camera. Learn if you can get notifications through push alerts, text messages, and or e-mail. They'll keep you abreast of anything happening real-time near your camera. You'll also pay more for professional installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, especially for cameras. And to be truthful, we're not terribly impressed by ADT's cameras in the first place. What you're paying for is mostly that big name in blue. </p>
