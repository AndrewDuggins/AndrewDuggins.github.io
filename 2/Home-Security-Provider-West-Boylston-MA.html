<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common. If a house owner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by a community cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>

There are at least 11 different smart home brand names that deal with Ring, including Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Ecolink, Yale, Schlage, and GE. Protect America subcontracts its monitoring services to POLICE OFFICERS Monitoring, an award-winning, UL-certified company with 6 nationwide monitoring stations and a 16.2-second average priority alarm response time.
