<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We likewise discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
