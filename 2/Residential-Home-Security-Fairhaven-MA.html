<h3>Wireless House Alarm Fairhaven MA 02719</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first saw Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send alerts, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

They work rapidly: most thefts are committed within a span of 10 minutes or less.</p>
