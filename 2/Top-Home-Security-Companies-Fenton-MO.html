<h2>The Major Weakness Of Using A CCTV Security System Fenton</h2>
<p>In the past, a surveillance security system generally included a number of cameras connected-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which recorded the images and displayed them on a closed circuit tv (CCTV) or monitor. Nowadays, it's a lot easier to have a standalone security camera. Whether you have one camera or several, they work with your home's internet network to send video right to your computer or mobile device. Many consumer cameras save data internally, on a removable microSD card, or from another location on the cloud.</p>
<p>Extra features. A wireless security system is not limited to a specific amount of devices that can be equipped. You can install an outdoor security camera with night vision, door sensors, window sensing units, motion sensing units, a control panel, a video doorbell with motion detection, a doorbell camera with two-way audio, extra cloud storage, a surveillance camera, wise smoke alarm, and more. Like we stated, a wireless system has nearly endless capacity for clever equipment.</p>
