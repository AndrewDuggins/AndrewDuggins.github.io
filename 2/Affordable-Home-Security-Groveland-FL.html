The first task is the alert of a siren, this allows for everyone in your area consisting of the homeowners or company owner to know that an intruder has actually been found. The second job is flashing outdoor lights. Not all alarm systems have flashing outdoor lights but the most common alarm system and some of the more advanced ones do. The most common type of alarm system have an auto dialer which informs cops in the location to dispatch to business or the home that is being burglarized.
