The usual factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying an opportunity for the destructive attacker to tape these codes and utilize different splitting tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools available which can introduce a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based upon the "design" security essential recorded during the network healing.</p>
