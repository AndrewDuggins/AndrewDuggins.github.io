<p>The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Considering that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to by hand stop alerts (and recording, considering that it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with 2 Hive test units detaching eight times over 2 months.</p>
<p>Given that the glass housing does not get in the way, they aren't quite as vandal-proof as dome cameras, but they offset it in abilities. In addition to being terrific for re-positioning on the fly, they are much better for low-light and infrared given that the glass housing doesn't impede the lens. With some, it's tough to tell at a glance where they've been intended, so they can give a panoptic impression as a deterrent, regardless of their real field of view. Setting up a video surveillance system with a few of these is an excellent alternative for a number of different configurations.</p>
<p>The occurrence of video surveillance systems as a service (VSSaaS) service has risen over the last few years. Although local storage is effective in its own respect, it has numerous caveats.
