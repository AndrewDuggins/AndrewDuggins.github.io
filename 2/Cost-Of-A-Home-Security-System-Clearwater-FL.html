We enjoy that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just alerts you when motion is produced by something with the same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no false informs). However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have extra sensors and essential fobs, too.</p>
