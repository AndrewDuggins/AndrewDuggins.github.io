<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires.
