<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency considering that it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
