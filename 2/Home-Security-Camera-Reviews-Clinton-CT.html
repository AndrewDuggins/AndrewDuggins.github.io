<p>Prior to you do business with anybody selling a home security or alarm system, whether they come to your door or you seek them out, the FTC and your state Attorney general of the United States advise you to ask possible contractors for the following information.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in several areas around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera utilizing an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android smart device (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint provides a wide array of equipment and home automation products at a reasonable cost, the one location where the company especially stands out remains in DIY installation. </p>
