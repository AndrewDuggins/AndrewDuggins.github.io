<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

However, Nest does provide excellent equipment with lots of space to include on and broaden your system as your needs alter. The best method to find the right no-monthly-fee security system for your home is to dig in and do your research.</p>
