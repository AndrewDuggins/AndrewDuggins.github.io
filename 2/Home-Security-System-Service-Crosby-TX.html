<p>Cameras typically relay video footage over the Internet, allowing operators to monitor security camera feeds from another location. In some cases, surveillance systems are paid for and run by the cities themselves. However in other cases, residents and companies share surveillance camera video with policeman.

Monitors can be connected to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be set up to interact through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
