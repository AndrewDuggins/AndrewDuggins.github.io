<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
