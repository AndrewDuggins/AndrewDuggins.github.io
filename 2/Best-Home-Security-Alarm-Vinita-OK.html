<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
<p>When I ultimately got into the camera controls, I was reasonably amazed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are relatively obvious.
