<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common. If a house owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by a community cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. False alarms take place.
