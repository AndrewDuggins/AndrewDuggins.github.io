The technology gradually developed into the highly advanced yet cost effective systems offered today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>
