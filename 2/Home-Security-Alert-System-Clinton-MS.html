<p>Ring might not be the most sophisticated system on our list (Vivint takes that prize), but it sure has actually gained quite the excitement over the years. We've been evaluating Ring Alarm quite a bit lately, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security kit that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low monthly monitoring fees. Or ... no monitoring fees at all if you select the complimentary self-monitor" choice.</p>
<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we concur with its suggestion that users should reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure. All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such occurrences. However, after this most current entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have actually decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we don't believe that these problems change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our present recommendation.</p>
