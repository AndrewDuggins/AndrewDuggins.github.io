<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be dealt with the very same way as public cameras? We likewise require to draw great lines about 'Who truly is watching you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Huge bro? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who draws the line in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one!
