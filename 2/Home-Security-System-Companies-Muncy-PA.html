<p>For these separate systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single user interface, a comprehensive understanding of all the required systems is necessary. If there are no as-built files supplying functionality and setup information to make this combination work, there are just two options. The very first alternative, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is unavailable or unwilling to offer those details) and document the geography and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other approach is to rip and change, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
