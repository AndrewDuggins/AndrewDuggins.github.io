<p>SmartThings supports Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2, the Pro Base Station, Arlo Q, and Arlo Q Plus. You can set off a video clip or a SmartThings automation if your camera detects motion or noise. This sequence of occasions also operates in reverse.

When the magnet is moved away from the reed switch, the reed switch either closes or opens, once again based on whether or not the style is generally open or normally closed. This action paired with an electric existing (typically at 12V DC) permits an alarm control panel to spot a fault on that zone or circuit.
