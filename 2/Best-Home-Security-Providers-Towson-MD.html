<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times most likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and operates its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service includes an advantage called ASAPer, which at the same time messages a group of pre-set contacts to identify whether alarm activity is a real emergency situation or incorrect alarm. Most monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow action times.</p>
<p>After evaluating lots of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for many people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be established both inside your home and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment pricing is incredibly reasonable, so it's not an overall splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
