However, remember that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.
