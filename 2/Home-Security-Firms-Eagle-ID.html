<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum performance.

For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal.

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
