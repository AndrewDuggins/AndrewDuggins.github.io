<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security because it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
