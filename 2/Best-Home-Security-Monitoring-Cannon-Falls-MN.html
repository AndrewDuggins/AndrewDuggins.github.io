<p>In spite of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension package, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more expensive general per system than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof service. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it since its battery-saving routines can disrupt efficiency.</p>
<p>The Kasa Camera Outdoor is a good all-around weatherproof home security camera that costs less than $100. However, there are a few tradeoffs with this camera. Unlike other outdoor cameras on this list, the Kasa Camera has to be plugged in to an outlet to get power, and while the camera is weather-resistant, the connection in between its cable television and power supply is not.</p>
<p>There's a couple of other cool features in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving items if it discovers an intruder; a handy intercom function that enables the gadget to function as a smart doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hey there doorbell ); and, given that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.</p>
