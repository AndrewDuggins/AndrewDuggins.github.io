And it is essential to understand that SimpliSafe's outdoor and indoor cameras options are limited, providing simply one indoor camera with very little capabilities. The huge 3 smarthome hubs (Alexa, Assistant, and Siri) will connect simply fine with SimpliSafe, nevertheless, not all third-party gadgets will connect.</p>
