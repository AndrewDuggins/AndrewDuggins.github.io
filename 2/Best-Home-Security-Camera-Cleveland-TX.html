<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even identify people you've labeled (after a learning duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>When it pertains to technology, reliability is an extremely subjective matter, depending on which functions and advantages an individual favors. Wireless security systems are more integratable and nimble, however low signal strength and poor connectivity are still common grievances. Hardwired systems require very little upkeep, and short of a general power interruption, are more difficult to disrupt. In spite of a basic improvement in wireless innovation, there seem less ways for hardwired systems to be interfered with and disarmed. </p>
