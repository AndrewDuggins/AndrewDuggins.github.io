<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the precise same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical existing.

If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which indicates. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved.
