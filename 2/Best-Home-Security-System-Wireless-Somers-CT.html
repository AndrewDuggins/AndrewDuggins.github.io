<h3>Alarm Security System For Home in Somers CT</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
