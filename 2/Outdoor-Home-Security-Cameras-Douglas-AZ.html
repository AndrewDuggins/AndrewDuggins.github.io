<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, spanning numerous decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly developed into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems readily available today.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. If capturing footage in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
