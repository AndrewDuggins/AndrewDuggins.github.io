<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially cutting-edge, so we're actually suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan option. Sure, you get a lower price if you go with a three-year contract, but given that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a big commitment. So select what will be the better deal for you. If you know you'll stay put for a minimum of three years, go with the agreement and reap those cost savings. But if you might update to a new office with various security requirements, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
