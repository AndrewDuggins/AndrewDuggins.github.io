<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the hub) is $399, and extra cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra does not come with a complimentary tier of cloud storage, so you have to invest at least $3 each month if you wish to save any videos. And if you wish to save 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera per month, on top of the regular monthly strategy, the latter of which is waived for the first year.

The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers cast doubt on the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or four totally free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front incentives to encourage owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
