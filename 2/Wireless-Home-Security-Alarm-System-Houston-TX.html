<h2>Video Surveillance Camera Systems Houston</h2>
<p>The Blue by ADT Outdoor Camera is a work in development. We have actually seen improvements during our brief time with the battery-operated camera, but we simply can't recommend a $200 camera that does not offer the capability to zoom video and will not have the ability to withstand outdoor temperature levels below 14 degrees Fahrenheit.

<p>If you do encounter a home invasion emergency situation, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am somewhat disappointed by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food processor whereas many other alarm are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm should be enough to frighten intruders most of the times. To recover expenses and hold alarm companies liable for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company must be licensed, pay any registration or false alarm charges, and supply physical proof like camera footage or a damaged window to require police action.</p>
