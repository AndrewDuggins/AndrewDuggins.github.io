<p>The cost of increasing your home's IQ differs depending upon how you do it. For instance, home security systems like Vivint and ADT consist of services and functions that fall within the realm of home automation-- surveillance cameras, two-way voice, compatibility and integration with clever thermostats, clever door locks you can remotely unlock, etc. In circumstances like these, you're paying for the service and not the equipment, so you're looking at anywhere from $29-$ 50 a month.</p>
<p>A clever lock is typically part of a robust wise home security setup, but you don't need to invest in a full-blown system to use one. If you're using a home automation hub to control things like lighting and thermostats, you can include a Z-Wave or Zigbee smart lock to the system without much effort. At the same time, if you don't have a home automation center, try to find a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that comes with its own mobile app. Smart locks use standard pre-drilled holes and are relatively simple to install. Some models use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and attach to the inside of your door, while others need that you remove your existing exterior and interior escutcheons and change the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>

Now, most security systems involve a multitude of components, such as a base station, security camera, glass, motion, and entry break sensing units, a keypad, and essential fobs, among other elements. However I also appreciate minimalist systems that elements that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some elements can make home automation offered to you. Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensor, window sensor, smart lock, etc.), I wish to make sure that they all quickly communicate with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
