Usually, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is a lot of readily available light, and as soon as the lighting ends up being low or absent (think sundown or nighttime), their pedigree begins to show.

<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the required systems is necessary. There are only 2 choices if there are no as-built files offering functionality and setup details to make this integration work. The first option, which might be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is unwilling or unavailable to supply those information) and record the geography and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and replace, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>
