<h2>Opposing Arguments To The Use Of CCTV Security Camera Surveillance Sullivan</h2>
<p>Despite having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can safeguard that plug and include another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension kit, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 ends up being more costly general per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it given that its battery-saving routines can interrupt performance.</p>
