<p>When you get a wireless self monitored alarm, be sure to keep the base gadget in a central area so all the different gadgets remain in close proximity to it. It will tape clips when it sees movement (and a couple of seconds prior to so you get the full view of what occurred) and you can view these for a week before they're erased.

The broad face of the camera offers you a remarkable visual field, and the image you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more information you'll use to save it to the cloud.)
