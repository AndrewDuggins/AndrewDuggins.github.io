If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we don't believe that these problems modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our present recommendation.</p>
