<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and operates its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service includes a benefit called ASAPer, which simultaneously messages a group of pre-set contacts to identify whether alarm activity is a real emergency or incorrect alarm. The majority of monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow action times.</p>
<p>We didn't think about alarm systems that needed professional installation. Pro-installed systems generally cost more, use equipment similar to that of DIY systems, come with long and normally onerous agreements, and often rely on the exact same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little advantage. A fine example is the Vivint system, which we have actually examined individually and don't advise for many people.</p>

A good home security camera should likewise have a scheduling feature, so that you can turn it off while you're home, and on when you leave.</p>
<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The recorded digital video stream is then transmitted over a local area network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to communicate via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>

<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complicated than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
