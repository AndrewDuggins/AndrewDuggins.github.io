<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Offered. Standard components in the majority of home security packages include a master control panel, the control keypad, sensing unit pads for windows and doors and a motion sensing unit device. Some systems are linked to an offsite alarm monitoring service, while others have at home alarms. Naturally you can buy more equipment like surveillance cameras, glass break sensors, CO detectors and smoke detector.</p>
<p>The other major choice when selecting a home security camera is whether you require an outdoor or indoor camera.

Thankfully, I've evaluated out lots of cameras and condensed everything I've discovered into the list below. These are the very best home security cameras in every major sub-category, from smart doorbells to the designs that work well with Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri voice commands - and beyond.

<p>The Hive View delivers great 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation activated too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting.

We also experienced above-average connection problems, with 2 Hive test units detaching 8 times over two months.</p>
