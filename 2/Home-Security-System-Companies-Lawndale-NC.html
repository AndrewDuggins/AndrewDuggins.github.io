<h2>Monitored Alarms Before Signing Up To That Expensive Monitoring Contract Lawndale</h2>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning a number of decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually evolved into the highly advanced yet economical systems offered today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and watch it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>

Alternately, if you don't have a home automation center, try to find a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that comes with its own mobile app. Smart locks utilize standard pre-drilled holes and are fairly easy to install. Some designs use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and connect to the within your door, while others require that you remove your existing interior and exterior escutcheons and change the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
