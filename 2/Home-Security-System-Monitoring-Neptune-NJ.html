<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly typical.

With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly.

<p>I described that all we would need to do is take advantage of any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise included two-way audio, which camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a client pushes the emergency situation button, it sends dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if needed, might just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
