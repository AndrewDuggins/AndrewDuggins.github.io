With many DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Set, the Ring Alarm Security Set, and the Nest Secure, you purchase the hardware outright and can avoid any regular monthly charges if you decide to self-monitor.

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. If capturing footage in the dark is a priority, make certain your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
