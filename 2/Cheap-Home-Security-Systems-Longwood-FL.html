<p>Like any huge purchase, it's smart to look around for a while prior to deciding when and where to buy a wireless security system.

<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had actually suffered an information breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a preventive step. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such occurrences. Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we do not think that these concerns alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our present recommendation.</p>

<p>What really sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be expensive but is important. In truth, we do not suggest buying this camera at all unless you plan to add the membership. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity.
