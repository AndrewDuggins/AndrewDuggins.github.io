<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>In addition, IP cameras work with network video recorders (NVRs), which provide several other advantages over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover.
