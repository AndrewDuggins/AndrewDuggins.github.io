Placed on shelves, tables, and countertops, they permit you to keep an eye on what your pets are doing, understand when the kids come home from school, or find who's been hitting the liquor cabinet.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
