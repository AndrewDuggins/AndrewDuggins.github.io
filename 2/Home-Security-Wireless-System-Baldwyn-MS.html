<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are slightly more pricey for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation costs are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyway.</p>
