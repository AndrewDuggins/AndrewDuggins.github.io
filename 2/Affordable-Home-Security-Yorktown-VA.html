However in other cases, citizens and organisations share surveillance camera video with law enforcement officer. Just like any security system, the more equipment you add, the costlier it gets.

Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Having the ability to distinguish between a vehicle and a person, for instance, permits you to cut down on unnecessary signals.
