<h3>New Home Security Systems in Michigan</h3>
<p>Clear night vision is among the most crucial functions for outdoor security cameras.

The number of infrared LEDs used in a camera figures out how far your outdoor security camera will have the ability to clearly reveal what's outside your home. Look for surveillance cameras that have at least 100 feet or much better of night vision. Numerous models also have an integrated IR cut-switch that instantly allows and disables the infrared innovation depending upon the lighting conditions.</p>

<p>Dome IP camera, as the name recommends, is a kind of CCTV camera with a dome cover. However beyond that I simply had problems.
