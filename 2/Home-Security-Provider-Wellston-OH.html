<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view.

It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually identified (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, however it implies you can ask your home security camera for the weather report - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the unit will reply. It likewise suggests that if you really saw a burglar riffle through your home, you might quickly record a message to him or her through your mobile phone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you envision, would suffice to send even the most committed career criminal scuttling empty-handed down the road. </p>
