<p>Seattle's main intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more responsible for false alarms, and reduce the number of unnecessary police and fire actions. Alarm monitoring companies are the specialists and must be teaching their clients how to appropriately care and set for their alarm systems.
