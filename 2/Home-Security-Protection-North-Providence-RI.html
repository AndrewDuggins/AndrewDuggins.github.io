<p>Home security systems and modern smart home abilities and compatibilities allow you to use their sensing units and cameras directly from your phone. Commercial homes tend to have even higher false alarm rates than residential properties because more people tend to share responsibility for activating and shutting down the alarm, and the systems tend to be more complicated.
