<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. The creative bit is that the camera not only finds that individuals have actually entered its 130-degree field of vision, however it will also have a stab at acknowledging them too.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally referred to as shock sensing units, are various because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
