<p>Last, we likewise think about how much it costs to view, share and conserve taped video. While some cameras still let you view a couple of days of tape-recorded video, the pattern has been to just let you see live video from your camera unless you sign up for a subscription. That indicates you can't recall a few hours or days to see who was walking through your yard. And, the majority of membership strategies also include additional functions, such as customized motion zones.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation activated too easily, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop alerts (and recording, considering that it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with two Hive test units detaching eight times over 2 months.</p>
