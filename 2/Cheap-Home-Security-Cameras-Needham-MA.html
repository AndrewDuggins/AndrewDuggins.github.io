<p>You can set off the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home invasion emergency situation. I am slightly dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm must suffice to scare away burglars in many cases. To recover expenses and hold alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company should be accredited, pay any registration or false alarm fees, and provide physical evidence like camera footage or a broken window to warrant cops action.</p>
