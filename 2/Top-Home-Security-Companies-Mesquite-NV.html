So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I was in, to get out I need to pay $783.  Truly annoying. Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to discuss it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump sum, due to the fact that obviously they auto renew you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be taken into account.
