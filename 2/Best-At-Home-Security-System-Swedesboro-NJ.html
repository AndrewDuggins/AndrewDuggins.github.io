<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
