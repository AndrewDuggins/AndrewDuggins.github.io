Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>The Kasa Webcam Outdoor is a good all-around weatherproof home security camera that costs less than $100. However, there are a few tradeoffs with this camera.
