<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical considering that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
