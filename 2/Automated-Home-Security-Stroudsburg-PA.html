<p>While every homeowner frets about break-ins, uncertainty has actually surrounded home security systems due to their typically high expenses, complex contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces typically leading to false alarms. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system connected together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, supplying trustworthy video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years ago, we invented security and alarm monitoring services.
