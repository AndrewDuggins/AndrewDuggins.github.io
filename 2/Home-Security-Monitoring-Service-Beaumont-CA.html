Because IP cameras have a wider visual field, too, an IP system can often deal with fewer less cameras than an analog system.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly typical. If a house owner forgets their keys and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is set off by a neighborhood cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>

Blink's app is fairly robust, and while it does not have all the bells and whistles of Arlo's cameras, this sub-$ 100 has lots of functions for the cost.</p>
