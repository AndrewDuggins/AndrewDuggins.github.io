<p>These cameras are capable of catching and sending really delicate information," states Cody Feng, a test engineer at CR's Digital Lab. That's why we evaluate them for data security and information privacy. Surveillance is the act of monitoring something or somebody, primarily to spot or prevent criminal offense.
