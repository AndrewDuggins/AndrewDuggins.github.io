<p>These cameras are capable of catching and sending really delicate information," states Cody Feng, a test engineer at CR's Digital Lab. That's why we evaluate them for data security and information privacy. Surveillance is the act of monitoring something or somebody, primarily to spot or prevent criminal offense. With this in mind, video surveillance is the act of observing something with the help of electronic monitoring and video recording.

In many cases, you'll be able to install cameras and electrical wiring just by running the wires through a drop tile ceiling and into the wall. Other tasks will require making use of channel - piping for running the wiring and securing it - and in some cases, removing part of the wall to lay circuitry inside. For these bigger jobs, professional security installation is normally the right choice.</p>
<p>Among the first decisions that you'll need to make is if you require a wireless or wired security camera system, and the appropriate response most likely depends upon where you intend to place the cameras and elements.

On the other hand, if running wires isn't reasonable, you'll take pleasure in the flexibility that Wi-Fi and wireless cameras offer. All these factors to consider will affect what system you eventually pick. For example, if you require to capture high-definition surveillance video over extended periods, bandwidth is a factor to consider.</p>
