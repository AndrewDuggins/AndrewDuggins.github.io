<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send smart device signals with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
