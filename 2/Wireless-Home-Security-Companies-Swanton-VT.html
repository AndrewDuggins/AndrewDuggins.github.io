<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
