All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside your home (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>The passive infrared (PIR) motion detector is among the most typical sensing units found in household and small business environments. It provides economical and trusted performance.
