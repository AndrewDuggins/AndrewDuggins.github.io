<p>6 basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Possession protection gadgets are developed to safeguard particular, tangible properties, such as jewelry, paintings, money boxes, and household treasures. These devices can be outfitted with anti-tampering technology to avoid being deactivated.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically referred to as shock sensing units, are various in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies generated are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer.
