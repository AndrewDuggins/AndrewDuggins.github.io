<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the patio by a licensed electrical contractor (who happens to be my other half). All of the cameras were linked to the very same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside your home (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
