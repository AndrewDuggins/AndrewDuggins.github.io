<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are slightly more pricey for the same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation fees are difficult, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyhow.</p>
<p>Furthermore they can not send fluid video, only still frame images or low resolution snippets of video. Blink Security Cameras are a good example of a system we are continuously helping clients change. As experts in the industry our suggestions is to keep away. If you do buy them, initially examine the providers return policy and 2nd keep the receipt.</p>
