The guidelines are extremely thorough and the 200m range of the alarm system implies it can be used to protect sheds and garages along with your home. The alarm system doesn't include a wifi security camera however you can buy a number of different Yale cameras that will deal with the alarm as optional extras. There's no external monitoring option with this alarm.</p>
