<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

Simply put, NVR records higher-quality video and permits systems to be scaled up far more easily than can be finished with DVR.
