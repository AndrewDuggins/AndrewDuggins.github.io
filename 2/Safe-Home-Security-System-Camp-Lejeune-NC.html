<h3>Wireless Surveillance Camera Camp Lejeune NC 28547</h3>
<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the fundamentals. But while ADT systems deal with Z-Wave devices, SimpliSafe systems don't.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
