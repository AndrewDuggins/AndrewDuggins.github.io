<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>

<p>Another essential topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much is enough.

The same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about four times as much photo details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
