<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
