<p>Some wireless home security systems provide a video recording storage option and others don't. For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; nevertheless, nothing is tape-recorded.

This option is usually cost-free. A cloud storage choice saves your video clips in the cloud.
