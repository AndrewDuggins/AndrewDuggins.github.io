<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually clearly tried to give it an attractive edge, and we have to give credit to its ability to show what's going on from up to 4 cameras at a time. It can be slow and awkward to utilize on occasion - with the process of connecting to the camera for a live view rather sluggish at times. The previous, cheaper version of the outdoor Nest web cam is still on sale too if you want to conserve some money - it does have a cable attached however, instead of working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit easier to undermine for possible intruders.
