<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular considering that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
