<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is certainly something to be considered. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal.

Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, smart lock, etc.), I wish to make sure that they all quickly interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
