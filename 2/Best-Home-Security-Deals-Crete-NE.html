<p>The Nest Webcam Indoor is the 3rd generation of the celebrated Dropcam-- one of the very first, and among the best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p. It's simple to establish and, thanks to its magnetic, rotating base, it can be set up practically anywhere inside. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be utilized as an intercom; and it interacts with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke detector, in addition to numerous third-party smart- home gadgets. However to actually use the camera's features, you'll have to shell out $10 or more monthly for the Nest Aware program, which provides you access to cloud storage, individual detection and adjustable activity zones.</p>
<p>For all the advantages of Nest Secure, the quality of customer care is not one of them. In reality, disappointed customers normally have a problem getting through to experienced specialists when they have technical issues. This is a properly designed camera and center combination, which includes a lasting battery, and which is readily available at a good price. It's absolutely worth a place on our list of the best security cameras 2020, even if there are some issues (the image quality isn't the strongest we've tested, for example).</p>
<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be pricey but is necessary. In fact, we do not recommend buying this camera at all unless you plan to add the subscription. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Being able to distinguish between a cars and truck and an individual, for example, enables you to cut down on unneeded signals. And Activity Zones are a good perk, especially if you're looking to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, an entrance, or perhaps garbage cans. </p>
