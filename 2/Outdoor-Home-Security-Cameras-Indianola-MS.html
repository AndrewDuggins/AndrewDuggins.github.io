If your security camera finds an unfamiliar face or burglar-- but it's definitely not very far, technology may not be at the point where an alarm will sound.</p>

We particularly like this camera's large, 180-degree field of view, since you're less likely to get a blind area wherever you set it up. For less than $400, you get 2 door and window sensors, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>

<p>For instance, the bullet cameras with repaired lens are generally smaller than those with zoom lens. SimpliSafe has the most outstanding action time of all home security companies we examined. Their timeframe for reaction in under 10 seconds, which we should admit is rather amazing.
