However, after nearly 2 years of usage, night and day images have actually always been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we came across when testing the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted.

We initially noticed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a staff (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.
