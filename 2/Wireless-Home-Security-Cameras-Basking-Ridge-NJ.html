<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to find it.

In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security since it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
