<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the precise very same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the alarm system. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
