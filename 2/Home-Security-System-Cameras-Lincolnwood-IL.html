<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Property protection devices are developed to secure specific, concrete assets, such as jewelry, paintings, money boxes, and family treasures. These devices can be outfitted with anti-tampering technology to avoid being deactivated. If the product to which the device has been attached is moved or disturbed, the sensing unit will trigger an alarm.</p>

<h2>Security & Surveillance Cameras Lincolnwood</h2>
