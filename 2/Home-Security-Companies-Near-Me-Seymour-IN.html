<p>Flood lights are typically utilized in conjunction with motion detectors. When sensors spot motion, the lights brighten the surrounding location, which will enable you to see who is on your property and will potentially scare off trespassers.

What you lose in resolution, especially at the edges of your field of vision, you make up for in dependability.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those individuals and will send smart device signals with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
