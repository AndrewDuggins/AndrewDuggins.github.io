<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a destructive opponent, since the disturbance of the network avoids the circulation of information and really indirectly safeguards data by preventing it from being sent. The usual reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering a chance for the destructive assaulter to record these codes and utilize different cracking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can release a dictionary design attack of "potentially accepted" security secrets based upon the "design" security key caught during the network healing.</p>
