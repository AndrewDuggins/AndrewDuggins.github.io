<p>The cost of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, due to the fact that it includes three outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month membership cost sounds pricey, but it's not so much when you consider that a live human is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras identify suspicious activity. That individual at Deep Sentinel's facility can alert a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local cops dispatcher if they refuse to engage or leave in a criminal act. It's not for everybody, but it's the best Do It Yourself outdoor security camera we have actually seen to date.</p>
