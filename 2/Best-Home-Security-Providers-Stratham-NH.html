<h3>Night Vision Security Camera in Stratham NH</h3>
<p>These cameras are capable of recording and transmitting extremely sensitive information," says Cody Feng, a test engineer at CR's Digital Laboratory.

With this in mind, video surveillance is the act of observing something with the assistance of electronic monitoring and video recording. It generally includes connecting camera to an IP network or taping gadget and monitoring the feed.</p>
<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is certainly something to be taken into account.

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security since it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
