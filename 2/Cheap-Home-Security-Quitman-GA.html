While most wise alarms use optional monitoring services, they're not as extensive as those used by standard alarms, which often dispatch the authorities if the alarm has been triggered and not confirmed as a false alarm.</p>
<p>Smart motion detection includes let you follow the action, whether it's a pet racing around the living-room or a youngster toddling towards trouble.

It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even identify people you have actually labeled (after a knowing period).
