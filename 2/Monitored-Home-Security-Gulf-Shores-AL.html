<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
