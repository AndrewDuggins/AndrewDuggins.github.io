As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
