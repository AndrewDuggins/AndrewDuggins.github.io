<p>We have been extremely delighted with the system, the people who represent the company and the security in which it gives our stores.

<p>While Scout's normally easy on the wallet, it does have one huge stopping working: it charges additional for self-monitoring. Systems like Nest Secure, House, and Ring Alarm will all let you self-monitor your system free of charge. But Scout makes you pay a $10 month-to-month membership cost. Wamp wamp. In the present era, use of security cameras has ended up being inescapable at houses, going shopping malls, roadways, workplaces and so on</p>
<p>What truly sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be expensive but is necessary. In reality, we don't advise buying this camera at all unless you prepare to add the membership. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Having the ability to compare a person and a vehicle, for instance, permits you to reduce unnecessary informs. And Activity Zones are a great perk, especially if you're wanting to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, an entrance, or even trash bin. </p>
