<p>A wired security camera can come in 2 forms, both requiring wires to supply power and for the purposes of video transmission. The camera's viewing angle determines just how much space the camera will cover. Wide-angle lenses minimize the variety of cameras required to monitor your home.

<p>The primary intent of the law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies and their consumers more accountable for incorrect alarms, and reduce the number of unneeded cops and fire responses. When reacting to unintentional or incorrect alarms, the fees offset the expenses to the Seattle Police and Fire Departments. More than 98 percent of all burglar and property alarms eventually prove to be false alarms.</p>

They'll keep you abreast of anything happening real-time near your camera. You'll also pay more for professional installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, particularly for cameras.
