<h2>Mobile Video Surveillance Canyon Country</h2>
<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the hub) is $399, and additional cameras are $299 each.

And if you wish to include more cameras - both bullet and dome varieties - you can add another 4 to the setup in total. Not all of home security systems include a camera. These are the very best that do.</p>
<p>Another aspect to think about is security, a wireless connection is rather easy for hackers to access. , if a hacker were to gain access to your wireless network they would also have access to the security cameras and the data being captured.. There are devices called wifi jammers that trigger the signal to jam rendering the camera worthless for taping that activity.</p>
<p>There's no devoted hub included here - each camera links directly to your router by means of Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.
