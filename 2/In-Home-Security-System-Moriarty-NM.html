<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. In a network injection attack, a hacker can use gain access to points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, particularly relaying network traffic such as Spanning Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects fake networking re-configuration commands that affect routers, switches, and smart hubs.
