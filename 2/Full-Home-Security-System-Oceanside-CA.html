<p>Piza and colleagues (2019) conducted a new review of the literature to update a meta-analysis by Welsh and Farrington (2008) that took a look at the impacts of closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance on criminal offense avoidance. The researchers searched for CCTV evaluations released between 2007 and 2017 to account for the duration given that the last evaluation (which covered assessments completed in 2006 and earlier). Methods included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV examination research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV examinations, and getting in touch with leading researchers to inquire about upcoming examinations.

<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously remarkable piece of technology.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
