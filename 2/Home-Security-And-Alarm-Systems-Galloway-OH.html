There's no latency so you get notified right away so you can take immediate actions such as setting off a loud alarm, calling the authorities, or using the camera's two-way audio system to speak to the potential intruders.</p>

False alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they happen regularly enough. Another prospective downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool must be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working.
