<p>While every property owner stresses over break-ins, skepticism has actually surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complex contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in incorrect alarms. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system connected together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, providing reliable video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years ago, we invented security and alarm monitoring services.

<h2>CCTV Video Surveillance Alabaster</h2>
<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can handle such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

Displays can be linked to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be established to communicate by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection. The recorded digital video stream is then transmitted over a local location network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which captures each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to interact through network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a very common type of two piece sensor that runs with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either typically open or normally closed when under the influence of an electromagnetic field as when it comes to distance to the 2nd piece which consists of a magnet.

This action paired with an electric existing (typically at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to detect a fault on that zone or circuit.
