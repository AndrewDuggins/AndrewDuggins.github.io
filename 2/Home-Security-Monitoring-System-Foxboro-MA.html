Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false sense of security since it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
