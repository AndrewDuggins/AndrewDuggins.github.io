<p>Furthermore they can not send fluid video, just still frame images or low resolution bits of video. Blink Security Cameras are a fine example of a system we are constantly assisting customers replace. As experts in the industry our guidance is to keep away.

It costs a lot, its prices isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to point out that the customer support experience varies widely depending upon the dealer you go with. </p>
