<p>If you're looking for motion detection, the Canary Flex includes a smart variation that sends out alerts directly to your phone. This camera provides a variety of features consisting of a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I described it as extremely middle of the roadway.

This more recent variation is similar, to be frank.</p>
<p>We also like that Ring still has good wise home support. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, do not work so well with wise home gadgets like lights and locks.
