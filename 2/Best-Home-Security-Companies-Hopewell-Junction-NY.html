<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare individuals and general motion.

We need to note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based on offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day.
