<p>Carbon monoxide gas detection. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that can be poisonous to both animals and human beings.

Luckily, most wireless security systems consist of carbon monoxide gas alarms that sound off if the amount of CO in your home increases to a dangerous level. With a wireless system, you can also receive push notices on your phone or tablet that let you understand there is an issue, even when you're not at home.</p>

The greatest image quality of DVD is just a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
