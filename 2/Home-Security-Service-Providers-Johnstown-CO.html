Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge.
