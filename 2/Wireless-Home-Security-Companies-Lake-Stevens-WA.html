<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
