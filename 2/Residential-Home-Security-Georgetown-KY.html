<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
