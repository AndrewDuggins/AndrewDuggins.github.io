<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and general motion.
