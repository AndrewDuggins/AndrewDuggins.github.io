<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the very same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the porch by a certified electrical contractor (who happens to be my husband). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition.

We likewise discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
