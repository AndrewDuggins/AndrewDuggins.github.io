<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.

Not to mention that the customer service experience differs widely depending upon the dealer you go with. </p>
