Normally you would discover a PCB with numerous terminals or antennas for connections. Many also have built-in backup batteries for wired systems and a phone or ethernet line in or out port.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
