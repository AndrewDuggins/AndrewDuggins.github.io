Nevertheless, remember that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.
