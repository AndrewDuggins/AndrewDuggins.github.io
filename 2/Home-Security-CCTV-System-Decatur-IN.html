<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into account. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal.

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range.
