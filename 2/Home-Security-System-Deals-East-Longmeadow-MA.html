<p>Extremely merely, the person at the door presses the button. You'll get a notice to your phone (you can also get a Ring Chime WiFi extender if you desire a doorbell noise too.) The camera then streams a video-link to your phone (or Amazon Echo Program, if you have one of those) - and because it works as an intercom, you can then have a chat with the individual at the door if you so wish.

<p>What really sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey however is necessary. In reality, we don't recommend purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to add the membership. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Having the ability to compare an automobile and an individual, for instance, permits you to reduce unnecessary notifies.
