<p>What really sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey however is necessary. In reality, we don't recommend purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to add the membership. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Having the ability to compare an automobile and an individual, for instance, permits you to reduce unnecessary notifies.
