<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore things that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.

Numerous sites requiring alarm setups no longer have traditional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with standard telephone dialer ability do not work dependably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>
